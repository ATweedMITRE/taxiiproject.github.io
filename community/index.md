##OASIS Transition
[DHS](http://www.dhs.gov/office-cybersecurity-and-communications/) has transitions TAXII, 
[STIX](https://github.com/STIXProject/), and [CybOX](https://github.com/CybOXProject/) to 
[Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS)](https://www.oasis-open.org/), 
a non-profit consortium that drives the development, convergence, and adoption of open standards for the global information society. 

The [Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) Technical Committee (TC)] (https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/cti) now leads the ongoing 
development of these standards. Organizations and individuals that wish to play a regular and active role in the shaping of these standards should consider joining OASIS and the CTI TC.

## Test Server
The TAXII Test Server is a proof-of-concept deployment of TAXII that enables testing of TAXII 1.1 capabilities. 
The TAXII Test Server demonstrates one way in which TAXII can be implemented and architected. Many other configurations, architectures, 
implementations, and deployments of TAXII are possible. More information can be found on the TAXII Test Server's home page.

The TAXII Test Server is available at [taxiitest.mitre.org](http://taxiitest.mitre.org/)
